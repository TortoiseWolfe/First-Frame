## Copy Below This Line

🎬 Every great film starts with a single frame.

Before the action, before the drama, before the audience gasps - there's that first image that sets everything in motion.

Building software should work the same way.

FirstFrame is a planning template that helps you see your project clearly before writing a single line of code. New features just dropped.

🎭 THE NAME IS INTENTIONAL WORDPLAY

🎯 "First Frame" - Like the opening shot of a movie, you need to establish your vision before the story unfolds. Start at the beginning. See the whole picture before you build it.

👓 "Specs" - These are your specifications, the detailed requirements that define what you're building. But specs are also glasses - the lenses through which you see your project with crystal clarity.

🖼️ "Frames" - The wireframes that hold your vision in place. Just like glasses have frames that support the lenses, your UI wireframes provide the structure that supports your specifications. They're the skeleton that gives shape to your ideas.

✨ Specs + Frames = clear vision, properly supported.

---

⛔ NEW: TWO-PHASE WORKFLOW WITH HARD STOP

This is the most important update.

How many projects have gone sideways because someone started coding before the vision was clear? The new workflow has a built-in checkpoint that forces that conversation.

**Phase 1: Vision**
📜 Define your project constitution - Your vision statement that guides everything
📋 Write feature specifications - User stories and acceptance criteria
🖼️ Generate SVG wireframes - Visualize every screen in your app

**⛔ STOP. Review wireframes with stakeholders before proceeding.**

**Phase 2: Implementation**
📐 Plan your approach
📝 Generate tasks
🤖 Implement with AI assistance

That checkpoint is where "I think I know what we're building" becomes "We agree on what we're building."

🧩 WHY SVG WIREFRAMES?

SVGs are text-based XML. When you create wireframes as SVGs, you're not just making pretty pictures - you're generating structured, semantic context that an LLM can actually understand.

Your AI assistant can read an SVG and know: "This is a 3-column layout. The sidebar has navigation. The main content has a data table. The detail panel shows the selected item."

That's infinitely more useful than describing your UI in prose. The wireframe becomes documentation that both humans AND machines can understand.

---

🔲 NEW: FOCUS MODE

Press F to hide the sidebar and footer. Just you and your wireframes. Press Esc to exit.

Sometimes you need to see the whole picture without distractions. Focus mode strips away the chrome so you can review your designs without UI getting in the way. Perfect for stakeholder presentations or when you're deep in design thinking.

---

📱 NEW: SIDE-BY-SIDE DESKTOP + MOBILE

Every wireframe now shows both layouts together on a 1400x800 canvas. Desktop on the left, mobile on the right.

Why this matters:
- Plan responsive from the first frame
- No switching between files or tabs
- See how your design translates across screen sizes
- Catch layout problems before you write code

The mobile view uses a realistic phone frame (360x700) so you get accurate proportions.

---

⌨️ NEW: FULL KEYBOARD NAVIGATION

The viewer now has complete keyboard support:

- Left/Right arrows: Previous/Next wireframe
- Up/Down arrows: Zoom in/out
- Plus/Minus: Also zoom in/out
- 0: Reset zoom to 85%
- F: Toggle focus mode
- Esc: Exit focus mode

No mouse required. Navigate your entire wireframe set from the keyboard.

---

🔄 NEW: HOT RELOAD DEVELOPMENT

Run `npm run dev` in the wireframes directory and see your SVG changes instantly. The viewer watches for file changes and reloads automatically.

This transforms the wireframe creation workflow:
1. Edit your SVG
2. Save
3. See changes immediately in the viewer

No manual refresh. No rebuilding. Just save and see.

📦 WHAT'S INCLUDED

FirstFrame comes with everything you need to start planning:

🖥️ Interactive Wireframe Viewer - Pan, zoom, keyboard navigation, focus mode. View your wireframes in context with an elegant dark-themed interface.

🎨 Example Component Library - Buttons, forms, cards, tables, status indicators. Use these patterns as starting points for your own component specifications.

⚙️ GitHub's SpecKit Built-In - The full SpecKit workflow is integrated. Define specs, clarify requirements, generate wireframes, plan implementation - all with simple slash commands.

🌗 Dark and Light Themes - Generate wireframes with `/wireframe` (dark) or `/wireframe-light` (light) to match your project's aesthetic.

📚 Self-Documenting - The viewer now includes tutorial wireframes showing how FirstFrame itself works. The tool documents itself.

🚀 GETTING STARTED

1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/First-Frame.git
cd First-Frame

2. Start Claude Code
claude

3. Begin planning
/speckit.constitution   (Define your vision)
/speckit.specify        (Create feature specs)
/speckit.clarify        (Refine requirements)
/wireframe              (Generate wireframes)

4. Review with stakeholders

5. Continue to implementation
/speckit.plan           (Design approach)
/speckit.tasks          (Generate task list)
/speckit.implement      (Build it)

⚡ WHEN YOU'RE READY TO BUILD

Your specs and wireframes become the blueprint. Two paths forward:

Option A: Fork ScriptHammer
https://scripthammer.com provides a ready-to-use foundation with Next.js 15, React 19, Supabase, and Tailwind. Your FirstFrame planning artifacts become rich context for implementation.

Option B: Stay in FirstFrame
Use the full SpecKit workflow right here: /speckit.plan, /speckit.tasks, /speckit.implement. Your specs and wireframes guide development without switching repos.

---

🛑 Stop coding before you know what you're building.
