## Copy Below This Line

🎬 Every great film starts with a single frame. Before the action, before the drama, before the audience gasps - there's that first image that sets everything in motion.

Building software should work the same way.

FirstFrame is a planning template that helps you see your project clearly before writing a single line of code. New features just dropped.

The name is intentional wordplay:

🎯 "First Frame" - like the opening shot of a movie, you need to establish your vision before the story unfolds. Start at the beginning. See the whole picture before you build it.

👓 "Specs" - these are your specifications, the detailed requirements that define what you're building. But specs are also glasses - the lenses through which you see your project with crystal clarity.

🖼️ "Frames" - the wireframes that hold your vision in place. Just like glasses have frames that support the lenses, your UI wireframes provide the structure that supports your specifications. They're the skeleton that gives shape to your ideas.

✨ Specs + Frames = clear vision, properly supported.

Here's the workflow (now with a built-in checkpoint):

**Phase 1: Vision**
📜 Define your project constitution
📋 Write feature specifications
🖼️ Generate SVG wireframes

⛔ **STOP. Review wireframes with stakeholders.**

**Phase 2: Implementation**
📐 Plan your approach
📝 Generate tasks
🤖 Implement with AI assistance

That checkpoint forces the conversation before you waste time coding the wrong thing.

🧩 SVGs are text-based. They're XML. When you create wireframes as SVGs, you're not just making pretty pictures - you're generating structured, semantic context that an LLM can actually understand.

📦 What's new in FirstFrame:

🔲 **Focus Mode** - Press F to hide UI during presentations. Just you and the wireframe.
📱 **Side-by-Side Layout** - Desktop + Mobile on one canvas. Catch responsive issues early.
⌨️ **Full Keyboard Navigation** - Arrow keys, zoom controls, no mouse needed.
🔄 **Hot Reload** - See SVG changes instantly with `npm run dev`.
🌗 **Dark + Light Themes** - `/wireframe` or `/wireframe-light` to match your aesthetic.

The viewer now includes tutorial wireframes showing how FirstFrame itself works.

🛑 Stop coding before you know what you're building.
