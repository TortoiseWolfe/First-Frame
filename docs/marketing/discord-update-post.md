🎬 **FirstFrame update** - new features for the planning template that helps you see your project clearly before writing code.

The name is wordplay:
🎯 **First Frame** - like a movie's opening shot, establish your vision first
👓 **Specs** - specifications AND glasses for clear vision
🖼️ **Frames** - wireframes that hold your vision in place

✨ **Specs + Frames = clear vision, properly supported.**

**New: Two-phase workflow with hard stop**
```
Phase 1: /specify → /clarify → /wireframe
         ⛔ STOP - Review with stakeholders
Phase 2: /plan → /tasks → /implement
```
Forces the conversation before you code the wrong thing.

🧩 **Why SVGs?** They're text-based XML. Your AI can read them and understand: "3-column layout, sidebar nav, data table, detail panel." Way better than describing UI in prose.

📦 **What's new:**
- 🔲 **Focus mode** - Press `F` to hide UI during presentations
- 📱 **Side-by-side** - Desktop + Mobile on one canvas
- ⌨️ **Keyboard nav** - `←/→` prev/next, `↑/↓` zoom, `0` reset
- 🔄 **Hot reload** - `npm run dev` for instant preview
- 🌗 **Dark/light** - `/wireframe` or `/wireframe-light`

The viewer now includes tutorial wireframes showing how FirstFrame works.

🛑 Stop coding before you know what you're building. 🎬
